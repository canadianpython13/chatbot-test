# chatbot-test

## Description

This is a testing project which runs tests on a chatbot, using Cypress in JavaScript.

## Installing and use

1. You will first need to install NodeJS and NPM -- install these first!
2. use ```npm init -y``` to initialize the project folder
3. use ```npm install cypress``` to install Cypress


### Editing
I used VS Code, which can be downloaded and installed from https://code.visualstudio.com/

## running the tests

There are several ways to run the tests:

use ```npx cypress open``` for running tests locally using the Cypress UI

In order to run the tests with a report, use ```npm run html-report``` this will run the tests in a headed mode with chrome by default. This can be changed in the package.json file
